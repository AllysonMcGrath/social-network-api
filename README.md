# Social Network API-MongoDB, Mongoose 

## Description

This is a project where we were required to create the backend for a social networking site. The app has two models, users and thoughts. A user can post, update, and delete "thoughts." They can also post and delete reactions to thoughts. Users can also add and delete friends. The project uses the NoSQL database MongoDB to store the data, and also utilizes Mongoose. There is no front-end for this project, but routes can be tested using a program like Insomnia.

The purpose of this project was to work with Mongoose and MongoDB in order to create models, controllers, and api routes.

## Installation

To download the repository, use the following command:

$ git clone https://github.com/AllysonMcGrath/social-network-api.git
